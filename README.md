# 📊 Case Study: Bellabeat — How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

Welcome to the repository for my Bellabeat case study! This project was completed as part of my **Google Data Analytics Specialization**. It explores how Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, can use smart data analysis to improve decision-making and product strategy.

> ⚠️ **Note**: While this case study is completed using R (as recommended by the specialization I took), please note that I’m more confident in Python than R.
